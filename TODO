BUGS
- walking dead
- fighting stacks of enemies creates zombie enemies

TODOS
- slow out the leveling curve
- different enemy names
- add adjectives to decorations
- implement map clear conditions (take artifact to key room)
- code the map change event - the UI should remain unchanged, the player level and gear will be retained, and a new map will be created
