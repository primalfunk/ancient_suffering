TODOS
- test combat for multiple enemies + player
- implement lantern light expansion, map expansion
- for room and region names, designate matching collections of regions so each reset has a common theme; enemy types to match
- add player name input to title screen

BUGS
- make sure rooms are cleared of items and enemies on reset; make a whole new map.

FOR LATER
- implement map clear conditions (take artifact to key room)
