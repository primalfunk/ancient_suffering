TODOS
- keep debugging the new combat logic, starting with "hit for 0 damage" condition
- alter data structure in words.json so we have a randomized list of valid light sources and use it in ObjectDistribution (static "torch" right now)
- test combat for multiple enemies + player
- implement lantern light expansion, map expansion
- for room and region names, designate matching collections of regions so each reset has a common theme; enemy types to match
- add player name input to title screen

BUGS
- sometimes enemy names don't show up in the room_display when there's an enemy in the player room

FOR LATER
- implement map clear conditions (take artifact to key room)
