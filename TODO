TODOS
- implement red crystal healing
- engineer and balance combat
- for room and region names, designate matching collections of regions so each reset has a common theme; enemy types to match
- start planning the game loop; is map solution taking out all the enemies?
- add player name input to title screen

BUGS
- refresh room display immediately after combat (or if anything dies)
- reset room lit conditions on game reset
